## problem Solving for the Linked List item

Solution for insert in linked list **DSL** and check if a specific item include or not , also print the result

![whiteBoard](../../imgs/linkedlist.png)

## Approach and Efficiency

Big O is O(1)
because the inserting is one by one individually

and for Searvhing the Big O is O(n);
because you will iterate around all item to find out the wanted item

===================================

## Task List

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
- [ ] delete items
- [ ] search by hash table
- [ ] double linked list
- [ ] cycle linked list
